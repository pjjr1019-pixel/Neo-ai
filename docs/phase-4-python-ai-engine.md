# NEO Hybrid AI — Phase 4: Python AI Engine

## Step 17: Setup FastAPI Endpoints
- Create endpoints: /predict, /learn
- Test endpoints with sample requests
- Log all actions and errors

## Step 18: Define Input/Output JSON Schemas
- Features, position, risk, action, confidence
- Document schemas and validate

## Step 19: Implement Feature Processing Pipeline
- Normalize, windowing, handle missing values
- Log processing steps and results

## Step 20: Design Model Architecture for Advanced Pattern Recognition
- Integrate Transformers (BERT, GPT, ViT), LSTM/GRU with attention, self-supervised/contrastive learning
- Document model code, diagrams, and logic

## Step 21: Add Automated Data/Model Lineage Tracking
- Use MLflow/DVC for tracking
- Ensure all model/data changes are reproducible

---
## Rules of Engagement
- Modular, explainable, and automated
- Document APIs, schemas, and logic in /docs
- Log all actions, errors, and test results
- Verify each step with sample data and tests

Update this file as Phase 4 progresses. Each step should be documented, tested, and logged.
