## BEST PRACTICE CODING/TESTING HABITS
# Notes
- Each phase includes verification: unit/integration tests, linting, static analysis, performance/security checks.
- All documentation in `/docs` (Markdown, Javadoc, Sphinx/docstrings).
- Log all actions, errors, test results, and fixes.
- Use project board for tracking and feedback.
- Prioritize modularity, automation, and explainability throughout.

---

- [ ] Add tests for benchmark_predict.py
    - [ ] Cover all branches, including exceptions and edge cases
    - [ ] Use type hints and docstrings
    - [ ] Use pytest parameterization for multiple inputs
    - [ ] Ensure flake8 and mypy compliance
    - [ ] Add comments for non-obvious logic
- [ ] Add tests for fastapi_service.py uncovered lines
    - [ ] Cover all branches, including exceptions and edge cases
    - [ ] Use type hints and docstrings
    - [ ] Use pytest parameterization for multiple inputs
    - [ ] Ensure flake8 and mypy compliance
    - [ ] Add comments for non-obvious logic
- [ ] Add tests for integration_test.py logic (if possible)
    - [ ] Cover all branches, including exceptions and edge cases
    - [ ] Use type hints and docstrings
    - [ ] Use pytest parameterization for multiple inputs
    - [ ] Ensure flake8 and mypy compliance
    - [ ] Add comments for non-obvious logic
- [ ] Re-run coverage and verify 80%+
    - [ ] Only mark as done if coverage increases or is maintained
    - [ ] Summarize what was changed and why at the end of each step
