# NEO Hybrid AI — Phase 5: Model Training & Selection

## Step 22: Implement Backtesting Simulator
- Simulate past X years of trading/data
- Log results and performance metrics

## Step 23: Score Model Performance
- Compute Sharpe ratio, max drawdown, win rate
- Document metrics and results

## Step 24: Automatic Model Selection
- Select top-N models based on performance
- Integrate hyperparameter optimization (Optuna, Ray Tune, Hyperopt)
- Document selection logic and results

## Step 25: Save Models for Java Inference
- Save models in PyTorch/ONNX format
- Use pruning/distillation for efficiency
- Document model saving and loading

---
## Rules of Engagement
- Modular, explainable, and automated
- Document all code, metrics, and logic in /docs
- Log all actions, errors, and test results
- Verify each step with sample data and tests

Update this file as Phase 5 progresses. Each step should be documented, tested, and logged.
