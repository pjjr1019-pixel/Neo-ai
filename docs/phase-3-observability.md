# NEO Hybrid AI — Advanced Observability

## Tracing
- Integrate distributed tracing for all microservices (e.g., OpenTelemetry).
- Log request/response flows and performance metrics.

## Explainability
- Integrate LIME and SHAP for feature importance and model explainability.
- Document explainability outputs and visualizations.

## Dashboards
- Set up dashboards for real-time monitoring (e.g., Grafana, Kibana).
- Visualize feature importances, service metrics, and logs.

---
## Example (Python)
# LIME/SHAP integration
import shap
import lime

# (Add model explainability code as models are built)

---
## Logging
- Log all observability actions, errors, and outputs.
