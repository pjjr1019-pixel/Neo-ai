# NEO Hybrid AI

A next-generation hybrid AI system for advanced pattern recognition, efficient learning, and robust automation.

## Goals
- Modular microservices architecture
- Advanced AI/ML with explainability
- Real-time data ingestion and decisioning
- Secure, scalable, and production-ready

## Key Features
- **Integration tested:** End-to-end integration between Java, Python, PostgreSQL, and Redis, with automated test logging.
- **Robust error handling:** All services and tests include exception handling and clear logging.
- **Modular codebase:** Each service is self-contained and documented for maintainability.
- **Production ready:** Handles external API failures gracefully and uses best practices for configuration and resource management.

## Structure
- `java_core/` — Java microservices (e.g., data_ingestion)
- `python_ai/` — Python AI engine and FastAPI service
- `docs/` — Documentation and integration test results

## Integration Test Results
See `docs/phase-5.5-integration-test-results.md` for the latest integration status.
